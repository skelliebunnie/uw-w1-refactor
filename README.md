Code Refactor Assignment

This assignment was to refactor the given code - both HTML and CSS - for accessibility. Change `div` tags to appropriate HTML5 syntax tags such as `section`, make sure heading tags are in hierarchical order (no `h2` after an `h3` for example), etc.

The final site (appearance is identical to the original, only HTML/CSS has changed).
